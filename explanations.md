## extract_sql_command

extract_sql_command, which is designed to extract valid SQL commands from a given text. The function attempts to find and extract valid SQL commands and return the longest one.

Parameters:

- text: A string containing the input text that may contain one or more SQL commands.

- dialect: A string specifying the SQL dialect. By default, it is set to 'ansi'.

- return_all: A boolean flag. If True, the function will return all valid SQL commands found in the input text. If False, it will return only the longest valid SQL command. By default, it is set to False.

Nested functions:

- concat_dict(dict_data: dict) -> str: This function is used to concatenate the values from a nested dictionary into a single string. It's used to process the results returned by the sqlfluff.parse function later in the script.

- get_check_positions(text: str) -> list[int]: This function is responsible for finding positions of SQL keywords (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, DELETE) in the input text. These positions will be used to identify possible starting points for SQL command extraction.

Processes:

- The main part of the script is a while loop that iterates through the characters of the input text. It starts at extract_pos = 0 and goes until extract_pos < len(text) - 2.

- Within the loop, the script checks if extract_pos is in the list of keyword_positions. If so, it means a potential SQL keyword is found, and it attempts to extract a valid SQL command starting from that position.

- The script uses the sqlparse library to parse the SQL statement starting from extract_pos. It filters the parsed tokens to include only DML (Data Manipulation Language), DDL (Data Definition Language), and CTE (Common Table Expression) keywords.

- It then tries to check the syntax of the extracted SQL statement using sqlfluff. If it passes the syntax check, it is considered a candidate SQL command. If there's a syntax error, it attempts to find the first violation's line and position to refine the candidate SQL.

- After obtaining a candidate SQL statement, the script applies some length filters to exclude very short SQL fragments. The extracted SQL command is then added to the res list, and the extract_pos is updated accordingly.

- The while loop continues until it has iterated through the entire text, trying to extract SQL commands.

- Finally, based on the value of return_all, the function returns either all the valid SQL commands found (res) or the longest one from the list (res) using the max() function.

## extract_json_command

extract_json_command, designed to extract valid JSON objects from a given text. The function attempts to find and extract valid JSON objects and return the longest one.

Parameters:

- text: A string containing the input text that may contain one or more JSON objects.

- return_all: A boolean flag. If True, the function will return all valid JSON objects found in the input text. If False, it will return only the longest valid JSON object. By default, it is set to False.

Processes:

- The script initializes an empty list res to store the extracted JSON objects and sets extract_pos to 0 as the starting position for character-wise analysis of the input text.

- The variable error_line_pattern is defined using a regular expression. This pattern is used to extract information about JSON decoding errors later in the script.

- The main part of the script is a while loop that iterates through the characters of the input text. It starts at extract_pos = 0 and goes until extract_pos < len(text) - 2.

- Within the loop, the script checks if the character at the current extract_pos is either { (indicating the start of a JSON object) or [ (indicating the start of a JSON array). If so, it proceeds with the JSON parsing attempt.

- It slices the current_text from the current extract_pos position to the end and tries to parse it using json.loads to check the syntax.

- If there's a JSONDecodeError while parsing, it means the current portion of current_text is not a valid JSON object. The script then extracts the line number and column number information from the error message using the defined error_line_pattern.

- If the error occurs at the first line and first column (line_no == 1 and position == 1), the script moves to the next character in the loop without further processing.

- If the error is at a non-zero line and column position, it extracts the potential JSON object (candidate_json) that caused the error, up to the point where the error occurred.

- The candidate_json is checked again for JSON syntax using json.loads. If it passes, it is considered a valid JSON object, and it's added to the res list. The extract_pos is then updated to skip the already processed portion of the text.

- The loop continues until it has iterated through the entire text, trying to extract JSON objects.

- Finally, based on the value of return_all, the function returns either all the valid JSON objects found (res) or the longest one from the list (res) using the max() function.
